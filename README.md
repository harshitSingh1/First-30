## 🔴 Problem Statement

**Every second counts in an emergency—but panic takes over.**

Imagine this: You're at a family dinner when your father suddenly clutches his chest and collapses. Your mind goes blank. You know you should do *something*, but what? By the time the ambulance arrives 15 minutes later, critical time has been lost.

Or picture a roadside accident—someone is bleeding heavily, bystanders are frozen, and nobody knows how to apply pressure correctly. The victim's condition worsens while everyone waits for help.

**The reality:**
- Emergency response times average **8–14 minutes** in urban areas, longer in rural zones
- The first 30 minutes are often the difference between life and death
- Most people have **zero first-aid training** and freeze under pressure
- Language barriers make emergency guidance inaccessible to millions

**First30.ai bridges this gap**—providing calm, step-by-step, voice-guided emergency assistance in the critical window before professional help arrives.

---

## 📊 Why This Matters

> The statistics are sobering:

- 🫀 **Every minute without CPR** after cardiac arrest reduces survival chances by **7–10%**
- 🧠 **Stroke patients** lose **1.9 million neurons per minute** without treatment—"Time is Brain"
- 🩸 **Severe bleeding** can cause death within **5 minutes** if not controlled
- 📱 **70% of cardiac arrests** happen at home, witnessed by family members who don't know CPR
- ⏱️ **Only 40%** of bystanders provide first aid before EMS arrival due to fear of doing harm

**First30.ai turns bystanders into first responders.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**First30.ai** is a voice-guided emergency assistance platform designed for the critical first 30 minutes before professional help arrives.

We provide:
- **Step-by-step guidance** for 15+ emergency types (bleeding, choking, stroke, burns, seizures, and more)
- **Voice narration** powered by ElevenLabs in 5 languages—so you can focus on the patient, not the screen
- **Location-based help** to find the nearest hospital, pharmacy, or emergency services
- **Calm, panic-proof UI** designed for high-stress situations with large buttons and clear instructions
- **Two modes**: Citizen Mode for bystanders and Dispatcher Dashboard for responders
